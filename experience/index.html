                <h3>Photography</h3>
				<h6>Jan 2019 - Present</h6>
                <p>I am an amateur photographer, mainly interested in Landscape and Wildlife photography, and have been running a small business for the past couple of years. Primarily located in the Wirral, but also photographing The Lake District and Yorkshire, where I am at Uni.</p>

				<p>The last three years I have produced and sold a Landscape Calendar of the Wirral. Along with this I also have my Lake District postcards up for sale in shops in local villages</p>

				<p>Recently I have got involved with more portrait and candid photography, taking photos for friends and family, as well as at York Engineering Society events, with me being the Secretary.</p>
