            <p>
                I am a landscape and wildlife photographer, located in The Wirral & Yorkshire, but also photographs The Lake District as well.
                I enjoy getting out and about taking photos of a wide range of scenes, and always love to challenge myself to come up with new creative ideas!
                Not only do I enjoy landscape and wildlife photography, but I also test myself to be creative and dip in and out of many other photography styles
                including flower photography, portrait and candid photography, as well as occasionally astrophotography.
            </p>

                When not behind the camera, I can often be found exploring remote locations, being both unique and having a natural splendor! 
                Accompanying this desire to explore is the drive and creativity involved in my Electronic Engineering degree, which I am currently completing at the University of York!
                I like to think that my approach to photography is to give a faithful representation of what is witnessed at each location, 
                producing photographs which capture a natural essence and accurately portray the atmosphere & character of the scene.
