        <p>
            Welcome to my portfolio website! I am currently studying at the University of York as an electronic engineering student, with a practical ability to explore, understand and develop creative solutions. I also enjoy helping people and solving problems, especially being involved in outdoor activities as well as volunteering in a wide range of areas.
