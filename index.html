            <p>
                Welcome to my website! I am an electronic engineer, with a practical ability to explore, understand and develop creative solutions. I also enjoy helping people and solving problems,
                especially being involved in outdoor activities as well as volunteering in a wide range of areas.
            </p>
            <p>
                On this website you can find information about various projects and other interests I have. This website is updated semi-regularly, so some areas are not always up to date or may
                currently be a work in progress.
