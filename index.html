            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
                Welcome to my website! I am currently studying at the University of York as an electronic engineering student, with a practical ability to explore, understand and develop creative
                solutions. I also enjoy helping people and solving problems, especially being involved in outdoor activities as well as volunteering in a wide range of areas.
            </p>
            <p>
                On this website you can find information about various projects and other interests I have. This website is currently a work in progress, but is part of a project I am working on to
                learn some basic web development and create a portfolio website in the process.
